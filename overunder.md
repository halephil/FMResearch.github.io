# Richmond County
Located on the top of the list is Richmond County. With nearly half a million people and only two farmers markets, it would seem to be the ideal relocation spot. Reasons are inclear to why markets are not branching to Staten Island, but your hotspot if Southern New York.
# Queens County
Comming is second, with a large 100,00 person difference is Queens County. Located just accross the bay would be the next locate to look into. With the cost of living being more and also, 21 more markets than Richmond, the compition is higher but still the second best location.
