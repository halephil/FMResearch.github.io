Thank you for checking out our research page on New York Farmers Markets. Our goal is to show the public how accessable farmers markets are in the state of New York. Along with that, we want to be able to display potiential counties that could use a more markets and even counties that have possibly too many markets. Hope you enjoy the data!

Topics of research on New York Farmers Markets:
  - Create a calendar to display the markets open throughout the week. Take that data a see how you could improve the times.
  - Locate over and under populated counties that have too many or too little farmers markets. 
  - Compare local retail food stores to the where to farmers markers are located.
